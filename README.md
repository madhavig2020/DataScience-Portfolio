Exploratory Data Analysis of AirBnB rental price affecting nearby housing in Chicago - Using R programming
README:
Airbnb, Inc operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities.The problem here I am addressing is how the the prices of Chicago AirBnB rentals affect the prices of the nearby neighborhood rent prices. Data science algorithm will help here to predict the prices of Chicago AirBnB rentals and also help to understand the correlation between the prices of Chicago AirBnB rentals and neighborhood rent prices.




Risk Factors of coronary heart disease in U.S population using Logistic Regression DSC 630
README:
The purpose of this project is to predict the effects of different parameters recorded in the data to predict mortality of the patient. By predicting so the physicians can determine high risk patients and can take better care of them thus helping them survive.

Airline safety dashboard using Power BI DSC 640
README:
The project is  the responsibility of looking into media reports that flying is no longer a safe mode of transportation as a data analyst for an airline corporation and develop a high-level dashboard with important data pertaining to airline safety to assist internal stakeholders in addressing this.As part of this project, we have created several visualizations, Dashboards, infographic and identified trends that support that airline travel is safer than cars. 




Auction items data processing pipeline DSC 650
READ ME:
In this term-end project, several big data technologies like Apache NiFi,Kafka, Hadoop & Hive were used to create a data engineering pipeline to find the top bidders who should be invited for auction in each category. 

Detecting fraudulent credit card operations with machine learning algorithms
ReadME 
This project will address the problem of credit card fraud, a major concern for banks and customers, and the process of detecting fraudulent operations through machine learning techniques.
The scam usually occurs when someone accesses your credit or debit card numbers from unsecured websites or via an identity theft scheme to fraudulently obtain money or property. Due to its recurrence and the harm it may cause to both individuals and financial institutions, it is crucial to take preventive measures as well as identifying when a transaction is fraudulent.

Predicting stock market performance 
README:
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive predictive model for forecasting stock market performance by leveraging critical macroeconomic indicators. I aim to create a data-driven approach that incorporates inflation, CPI, unemployment rates, durable goods orders, and interest rates to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of financial markets.


Twitter sentiment analysis Natural Language Processing
READ ME:
In this project, we'll build a 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's in-built sentiment analysis engine.We'll use a logistic regression classifier, bag-of-words features, and polarity lexicons (both in-built and external). We'll also create our own pre-processing module to handle raw tweets.

Weather Prediction App
README:
 This project uses request library to get weather data from OpenWeatherMap API based on the city or zip code that user enters at the prompt and displays it back to the user. We used Python programming for developing this.

Webscraping and reading a webpage with Beautiful Soup (DSC 540)
README:
In this project formatted dataset with at least 15-20 variables (if the API or Webpage you selected doesnâ€™t have that many fields available on it, you will want to search again, or do multiple!)
