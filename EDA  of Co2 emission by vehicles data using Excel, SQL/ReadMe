 what vehicle mechanical demographic variables are most correlated with an increase in CO2 emissions? I also had a few secondary questions I wanted to answer:
•	if low end priced cars and high-end premium cars got a variation towards fuel consumption,
•	if CVTs are more or less likely to be found on larger engines
