The project is  the responsibility of looking into media reports that flying is no longer a safe mode of transportation as a data analyst for an airline corporation and develop a high-level dashboard with important data pertaining to airline safety to assist internal stakeholders in addressing this. As part of this project, we have created several visualizations, Dashboards, infographic and identified trends that support that airline travel is safer than cars.
